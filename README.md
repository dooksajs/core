##Description

Dooksa is a fast, open-source super-lightweight low-code application builder

Dooksa enables developers, webmasters and even the marketing team, to manage the content and presentation of their web assets.
You simply build your application by editing sections of your application interface, adding content and actions as required. All in your browser, with no need to open a text editor. At the heart of Dooksa is an extensible plugin-driven architecture. Dooksa provides a simple method to create your own plugins to meet your specific application needs.

Dooksa provides a front and back-end system where you create your apps in the same manner, with the same syntax. and with the saeme processes.
Dooksa gives you unrestricted freedom over your own application project, to modify as it fits your needs. Importantly, there are no abstractions dependent upon version upgrades. The system has zero dependencies on node modules.

The system is fully extendable and does not require programming knowledge, but it does require an understanding of programming pronciples. It offers a low-code solution with integrated tools and a unified plugin system for both front and back end site development. The benefits of this include managing both the data and state of the application, and having to only learn one system in order to extend the back or front ends.
if you want to create a Dooksa application, run the create Dooksa script (insert link) and example it will be using the dist files from core.
