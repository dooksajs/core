> Please keep in mind that Dooksa is still under active development and full backward compatibility is not guaranteed before reaching v1.0.0. Dooksa is not yet recommended for production critical applications.

> Attention. This repo is not for building a website. It is for those who want to improve Dooksa. A separate repo will be made available [Create Dooksa Placeholder](https://github.com/dooksajs/create-dooksa) with a suitable Dockerfile to deploy to the cloud service provider of your choice.

##Description

Dooksa is a fast, open-source super-lightweight low-code application builder

Dooksa enables developers, webmasters and even the marketing team, to manage the content and presentation of their web assets. You simply build your application by editing sections of your application interface, adding content and actions as required. All this is done in your browser, with no need to open a text editor. At the heart of Dooksa is an extensible plugin-driven architecture. Dooksa provides a simple method to create your own plugins to meet your specific application needs.

Dooksa provides a front and back-end system where you create your apps in the same manner, with the same syntax, and with the same processes.

Dooksa gives you unrestricted freedom over your own application project, to modify as it fits your needs. Importantly, there are no abstractions dependent upon version upgrades. The system has zero dependencies on node modules.

The system is fully extendable and does not require programming knowledge, but it does require an understanding of programming principles. It offers a low-code solution with integrated tools and a unified plugin system for both front and back end site development. The benefits of this include managing both the data and state of the application, and having to only learn one system in order to extend the back or front ends.

If you want to create a Dooksa application, run the create Dooksa script (insert link) 

The complete create script does not yet exist. There is a playground, See below, to explore the working of core Dooksa.
