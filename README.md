# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Dooksa

> [!WARNING]  
> Please keep in mind that Dooksa is still under active development and full backward compatibility is not guaranteed before reaching v1.0.0. Dooksa is not yet recommended for production critical applications.

> Attention. This repo is not for building a website. It is for those who want to improve Dooksa. A separate repo will be made available [Create Dooksa Placeholder](https://github.com/dooksajs/create-dooksa) with a suitable Dockerfile to deploy to the cloud service provider of your choice.

##Description

Dooksa
 
* Is a fast, open-source, super-lightweight, low-code, general-purpose application builder
* Enables developers, webmasters and even the marketing team, to manage the content and presentation of their web assets
* An application is built by editing sections of the application interface, adding content and actions as required
* All this is done in a browser, with no need to open a text editor
* At its heart, it is an extensible plugin-driven architecture
* Provides a simple method to create custom plugins to meet specific application needs
* Is a "full-stack" system where the app frontend and backend are developed in the same manner, with the same syntax, and with the same processes
* Gives developers unrestricted freedom over their own application project, to modify as it fits their needs
* Importantly, there are no abstractions dependent upon version upgrades. The frontend system has zero dependencies on node modules.
