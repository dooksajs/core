## How to contribute to Dooksa

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a complete GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Dooksa*, just email [Support](mailto:support@dooksa.com) and we can take it from there** Note that this a placeholder while we create a complete security policy. We do not publish details of vulnerabilities publically until the threat is properly addressed,

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dooksajs/dooksa/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dooksajs/dooksa/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **demonstrable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* In the absence of formal guidelines, please keep code in the "spirit" of the existing code [guidelines are forming as we speak!]

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
